## Streams React app

### Description
A React/Redux app using OAuth2 and a simple REST API using JSON server

Note: this is just for local use as you do not want to publish a build to production with a secret in the client side code!.

### Get started
- You will need a client ID in the Google developer console - https://console.developers.google.com
- Add the secret to a `.env` in the root dir
- CD into the `api/` dir and `npm install && npm start`
- CD into the `client/` dir and `npm install && npm start`

### Enjoy :-)
